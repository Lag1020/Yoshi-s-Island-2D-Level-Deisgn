# Yoshi-s-Island-2D-Level-Deisgn
Exploring the tutorial, first level, and other aspects of the game!
1) What is the game feel of the game in the level that you chose?

a) Describe the aesthetic sensation of control (floaty, fluid, responsive, tight, slippery, etc.). What does it feel like to control the avatar and why?

Controlling Yoshi, for the most part, is satisfying. Jumping feels snappy and responsive, relative to the player’s input. Yoshi is appropriately heavy, meaning that after a jump, they fall quickly. A player can hold down the jump button to jump higher, and holding the button long enough makes them flutter, allowing them to reach higher platforms. On the ground, if Yoshi moves uninterrupted for a second, they will start accelerating without any extra button presses. 

b) Describe the simulated space and physical reality of the game. (Gravity, friction, acceleration, hit box sizes, collision behavior, etc.)

The gravity, while it feels strong, is countered by Yoshi’s flutter jump, making a good balance between quick actions and forgiving platforming. The landscapes of some of the areas in a level look pretty rugged, with hitboxes that compliment those visuals.![2023-01-30 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124026838/215687953-f4af750c-e2f8-4fcc-b529-f8f7b6d9c460.png)
 The speed of the player accelerates relatively quickly, capping off at a fast, but manageable speed. The speed does vary when Yoshi transforms into other objects, but the player doesn’t have to worry about that during the first level.

c) Describe some specific polish elements that work together with the above elements to evoke the game feel.

Yoshi is able to swallow enemies and turn them into eggs, using them as projectiles. Yoshi can do all these actions while moving around, keeping the pace of the game going. They face the same direction while targeting enemies with eggs, even when the player moves the opposite direction, preventing any awkward targeting or accidental throws. Of course, the problem with this is that the player would have to reset their targeting so that they could face an enemy that is creeping behind them, but that aside, Yoshi’s controls feel fluid, and they contribute to keeping the game at a good pace.

2) How does the level design support that game feel? (Is the game giving you obstacles or layouts that fit the game feel? For example, does a racing game have interesting turns in the course? Does the shooter have enemies to shoot and cover to shoot around?) 

As I mentioned previously, the landscape of some parts of a level feels rugged, as in uneven in structure. There is rarely a moment where the level is pretty much a flat area. The player has to traverse through slopes, mazes, or even just a slanted boulder in a lot of the other levels of the game. The way the levels are structured feel as if they compliment Yoshi’s movements. Yoshi can flutter as a way to reach higher areas and control their trajectory, so the rugged nature of the levels do feel like they complement the mechanics well. Although, sometimes, the mazes can get a bit cramped for Yoshi’s movements, creating some awkward situations, like running into Piranha Plants or Propeller Piranhas.![Yoshi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124026838/215688715-6ad3756d-a9b9-41e5-98fc-432cb4432161.png)


3) Describe a pedagogical technique that serves to guide or teach the player like signage, color coding, button prompts, tutorials, etc.

Yoshi’s Island starts off with a skippable tutorial level after the first cutscene of the game. The tutorial level is less of a tutorial, and more so a “Here’s a very safe space you can move in, move on when you get the basics” type of level. The level does have boxes Yoshi can hit if the player needs instructions. ![2023-01-30 (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124026838/215687302-0147202a-0eee-496e-b2a4-836b4fc49cb3.png)
The boxes are scattered around the game, detailing buttons or mechanics the player can learn about, and they can be skipped if the player does not need them. The first “actual” level builds off this concept. It starts with a tutorial box, a safe space with weak enemies, and a chance to explore the mechanics. Continuing a bit further, the player may notice two objects: a floating cloud and a Piranha Plant. ![2023-01-30 (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124026838/215687815-edffbeea-9a8f-4041-9a4d-c40396e424f1.png)
Both serve the same purpose: Urge the player to experiment with the egg throw mechanic. The rest of the level uses a combination of these concepts, while introducing new ones.

4) Explain a notable affordance that succeeds or fails at intuitive interaction design.

An affordance that succeeds is the combination of mobility and the targeting mechanic. Once the player gets a handle of Yoshi’s controls, they can perform a lot of actions at the same time, allowing for a good flow of gameplay. This, however, is a double-edged sword. There is only a good flow if the player is confident in their actions. Most players may stop to concentrate on a target, halting any pacing of the gameplay. The mechanics may not be as complicated as those in other 2D platforming games, but for players who are generally new to games, or at least only played Super Mario Bros. games, they may feel overwhelmed. It may not be all that difficult to learn for some people, but I can see how that might turn some people away from the game. It still follows the design philosophy as other Super Mario games: Easy to learn, hard to master.

5) What is the pacing of the level design? Does it fluctuate?

a) How does the difficulty level change as the level progresses?

Being the first level, it starts off easy. The number of enemies and objects increase as the player moves on, while not being overwhelming. The level ends similarly as how the level started: Calm and uneventful. However, Yoshi’s Island has collectibles. In order to get a score of 100 points at the end of each level, the players need to collect 20 red coins, 5 flowers, and 30 stars (this game’s equivalent of health points). If the player decides to go for a completion, this ramps up the difficulty of every level. For example, in the first level, the player would have to get through Piranha Plants that would otherwise be out of the player’s way in order to collect a flower and some red coins. Then, they would have to find the clouds that contain stars.

b) How does the level pace the introduction and layering of new content or challenges?

The level starts off by introducing weak enemies and a flower.![2023-01-31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124026838/215688947-3ed0f9af-c9c6-41ce-bcf1-8a979699aca4.png)
 After that, the player is nudged to practice their egg throw attacks when they are being shown stationary Piranha Plants and a cloud with a question mark on it. From there, the player is introduced to the red coins and the rewards of exploration. All of this is being introduced to the player during the first 30 seconds of the game in a safe space. Even if the player is still getting used to the controls, they’re in a inconsequential area. While it constantly introduces the player to something new, whether that is reproducing Shy Guys, beanstalks, check-point rings, chomp rocks, there are plenty of breathing spaces for observations, and some of it can even be ignored.
